So. I wrote this article for Opensource.com.. So I am calling it a blog post :)
I have another article coming too from the superuser blog about the upstream 
training I did in Barcelona. I also have another article I wrote when I first 
started at the foundation so maybe I can put that here too. You can't say I 
haven't been writing, I just haven't been writing here. Working on that.

A new kind of match-making: Speed mentoring
The Women of OpenStack introduce groups of newcomers to mentors.
Posted 18 Oct 2016 Kendall Nelson


My primary focus is to make contributing to the OpenStack community easier and 
more fun.I'm an upstream developer advocate for the OpenStack Foundation, and 
this work includes bringing new people into the community, making sure members 
of the community feel valued, and reducing conflict and removing roadblocks to 
contribution. It's also part of my job to smooth the path for newcomers just 
starting to get involved in the community.

In many cases, people looking to contribute often don’t know where to start—a 
mentor can point new people in the right direction and help them feel involved 
and engaged.

A mentoring program
The Women of OpenStack recognized this need for mentors and started a mentoring
program that matches mentors with newbies based on the type of mentoring they 
need and other factors like: what area of the community they are interested in,
where they live, what sort of interaction they would like in their mentoring 
sessions, if they want technical or career help, and more.

We are currently running our second round of enrollment in preparation for the 
OpenStack Barcelona Summit, with the target of enrolling people four times a 
year (before each Summit and Project Team Gathering). OpenStack Summits and 
Project Team Gatherings alternate throughout the year, occurring about every 
three months giving people the opportunity to meet with other Stackers face to 
face. We hope to get as many people as possible enrolled and matched before the 
Barcelona Summit. Then, hopefully, many of our mentors and mentees can start 
their relationship with a face to face meeting.

Currently, we have over 150 people signed up to be mentors and mentees.

How it works
We send one introductory email to the mentor and mentee informing them about the
match. Then we give the pair space to make their own decisions about how and 
when to meet. We want them to decide what is best for them. Around three months
later we check in with a short survey, but mostly we leave the pairs alone to 
develop their relationship and trust they will come to us if they have 
questions.

Lately, we've been discussing what 'graduation criteria' could signal the end 
to the relationship. We hope to have more guidance for mentors and mentees on 
this soon.

Speed mentoring
The Women of OpenStack have a Speed Mentoring event that we hold at the Summits.
The goal is to start the Summit by introducing groups of newcomers to mentors, 
so they are sure to make a few connections at their first Summit.
A few volunteer mentors come and talk to groups of mentees, answer questions 
they have, and give guidance about where they can go for more help. It's been 
successful in the past and we hope to continue to grow the event.
