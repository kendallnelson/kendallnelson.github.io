And just like my failing to be consistent with posting, I fail to start that routine I laid
out in my last post.. Yesterday and today I kinda had a routine-ish. It looked more like this:

8 AM Wake Up & Breakfast & Tea & Work
10 AM Walk & Chat to people & Work
12:30 PM Lunch & Work
4 PM Nap & Work
6 PM Freetime & Netflix & Dinner

I guess that's good? Ish? I wonder if I can go 3 for 3 tomorrow. Lord help me make and sustain
a routine. I need something to help me pass the time.

My pole finally arrived so that was awesome. Got it put up and will start taking pole classes this
week for the first time in over 2 months. It won't be the same because its at home and I'll be
alone, but its a start I guess. One more day a week I have something to do consistently so that 
should help with the trying to make a routine. 

/me really starts whining..

My skin is terrible. Its like I'm going through puberty again. I've definitely put on weight but 
I'm too scared to step on a scale. 

I can distract myself for like.. an hour at a time at most.. and then it all comes back. The panic
about how long its going to take for things to go back to any semblance of normal. What the new
normal will look like. When I will get to go on a plane again. What I will do with myself until 
then.

Watercolors. Baking. Audiobooks. Biking. Walking. Games. Whatever. It only works for a little while and 
not as *thoroughly* as it used to. Sometimes my distractions can't even abate the thoughts completely.
They just fade a little. 

I'm open to other suggestions of things to distract me, if anyone has anything. 

Things I have baked to help abate the general anxiety:

- Lemon & Raspberry Bundt with a Raspberry Glaze (vegan)
- Chai Scones with a Cinnamon Glaze (vegan)
- Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies
- Crumpets (accidentally vegan)
- Sourdough Bread Loaf (thanks for the starter Rosie!) x2
- Sourdough Cheese Crackers
- Sourdough Pretzels
- Apple Crisp
- Sourdough Waffles
- Tunnel of Fudge Cake
- Sourdough Cardamom Cinnamon Rolls x2
- Lemon & Blueberry Cake
- Red Velvet OpenStack Logo Cake

Things on my list to bake:

- Brittany Butter Cake
- Cupcakes
- English Muffins
- Chocolate Souffle
- Triple Berry Pie
- Loaf (got a new pan)
- Bundt (got a new pan)

I should probably bake a little less since I will be the only one eating things now.. but
I need to bake..so if anyone wants something, let me know and I would be more than happy to 
share.
