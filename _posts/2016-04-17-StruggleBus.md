IT'S SO HARD to stay on top of this. I wish I knew the language this template
was in better so I wouldn't be stuggling to get things looking how I want so hardcore. Bleh. Anywho. Trying to get the portfolio to be a dropdown with the main

am doing. Fingers crossed that I can get that figured out in the next day or so.
Time is a wastin..The summit is in a week..*nervously bites nails*
