These days I spend all week looking forward to the weekend. But then I get to the weekend..
And then I spend all weekend looking forward to the next week. And the cycle goes on and on
and on and on and on and on and I really fucking hate it. 

I still have little to no motivation. I havent worked out in our home (garage) gym in over a
week. I only went on one bike ride last week. I did go for a run for the first time in like.. 
two months which was partially because I am like 98% certain I broke my foot at the end of
Feb/start of March. The run went suprisingly well, but then my foot started hurting again..
so I guess it will be another week or two before I should try to run again. The only real 
physical activity I do consistently is my active flexibility classes (Hi Tiffany!). They are
also the only real structure or consistent like.. routine I have (I have no routine besides 
doing those classes twice a week). 

I think having an actual routine might help..but again, no motivation. Maybe if I write down 
some rough routine here I could stick to it. Can't hurt to give it a try right? 

8 AM Wake Up
9 AM Breakfast & Tea & Work
11 AM Work out (except not active flex days), Shower, & Lunch
12:30 PM Work
3 PM Walk (weather permitting of course)
4 PM Work 

That would be so much better than my current lack of routine. Any sort of consistency would be 
spectacular. I dunno. We'll see. I can't really get any worse I guess.

Was thinking about maybe setting like.. one or two small goals for the day and seeing if that
helps with motivation? I dunno. That might be something to hold off on till I actually get a 
routine down. Don't want to set too many expectations and then disappoint myself when I do
none of them.. which is definitely a pattern of the last few weeks. I want to accomplish some
thing, I don't do it or fail to meet that expectation and then I get upset with myself and sink
a little lower mentally than I was at before and also have a little less willingness to set a 
goal and a little less willpower to do the thing. 

Things I have baked to help abate the general anxiety:

- Lemon & Raspberry Bundt with a Raspberry Glaze (vegan)
- Chai Scones with a Cinnamon Glaze (vegan)
- Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies
- Crumpets (accidentally vegan)
- Sourdough Bread Loaf (thanks for the starter Rosie!) x2
- Sourdough Cheese Crackers
- Sourdough Pretzels
- Apple Crisp
- Sourdough Waffles
- Tunnel of Fudge Cake
- Sourdough Cardamom Cinnamon Rolls

Things on my list to bake:

- Brittany Butter Cake
- Cupcakes of some sort
- Lemon Blueberry Cake (bought the stuff to do it and then lost motivation)
- English Muffins
- Chocolate Souffle
- Triple Berry Pie

Still need to do something with the discard after I feed the starter this week (normally
its a Sunday project, but.. you guessed it, no motivation). 

I kinda wonder if anyone actually reads this. I can only think of maybe four people that I sent the
website to ever. I kinda feel like I am just talking to an empty room and I probably am. Which is
fine I guess. I just wondered.

P.S. Sorry about no post last week. I thought about it a few times, but never actually got down to 
doing it and as you may have guessed, disappointed myself for breaking the lovely weekly cadence I
was building. Maybe this is me getting back on track?
