Getting anything done this week has been ridiculously hard.
I don't know what is so different from last week..but its
harder.

I feel a bit like I am stuck in limbo, which is probably
true of many people. Not just me. I feel like I am just..
waiting.. indefinitely.

I keep wanting to *be productive* if not at work than
doing something physically active- going for a run or bike
ride or using the home gym- but I can't bring myself to do
that even. I have no idea what changed. 

I keep half planning trips and stopping because who knows
when it will actually happen?

I keep being like, 'maybe I will do X this weekend...oh..
wait..I should stay home.' Its been over a month now and
we have AT LEAST three more weeks...till they extend the
stay at home order again.

I really want to hope that by June I can go on a trip
somewhere..but I kinda worry it will be July or August by
the time I can go somewhere more than like.. 5 miles away..
and not in a car..

I used to feel like I lived in airports. I didn't hate it,
but man did I take that for granted. I would KILL to have
a reason to need to go and be in the airport. I don't even
care about the destination. I just want to be *going*
somewhere.

Things I have baked to help abate the general anxiety:

- Lemon & Raspberry Bundt with a Raspberry Glaze (vegan)
- Chai Scones with a Cinnamon Glaze (vegan)
- Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies
- Crumpets (accidentally vegan)
- Sourdough Bread Loaf (thanks for the starter Rosie!)
- Sourdough Cheese Crackers
- Sourdough Pretzels
- Apple Crisp
- Sourdough Waffles
- Tunnel of Fudge Cake

Things on my list to bake:

- Brittany Butter Cake
- Cupcakes of some sort
- Lemon Blueberry Cake
- English Muffins
- Chocolate Souffle
- Triple Berry Pie
- Cardamom Cinnamon Rolls
- 

Also I just spent almost $100 on baking mixes from a couple
different places.. Because you know.. I'm not baking enough
as it is.

P.S. Microwave Update: Fuse didn't work either so we said fuck it and
and bought a different new microwave, one that had the vent and light
stuff it needs for being mounted above the range. Taking down the old
one and putting up the new one was quite the adventure but we now have
that all done and the 'temporary' microwave we had on the counter is
now living in the garage until we need it again.
