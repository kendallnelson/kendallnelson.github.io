Remeber how I set out that beautiful schedule? All those plans about getting back on track? 
Yeah. Me too. And then it didn't happen. 

Things are getting a little bit better though. Starting with one small good habit at a time. 
First I got vitamins and started taking them everyday. Did that for a week and then I started 
making sure I was brushing my teeth twice a day( I was averaging like.. 1.5). After that, I 
started a skincare routine- I have stuff I do for my face in the morning and evening (and it
is more than just washing my face and putting lotion on). Next I started waking up before 9 AM
consistently. This might not sound like much, but when I was staying up till 4AM it was hard to 
motivate to get out of bed before 11AM...So now I am on a before 1AM to before 9AM schedule. 

Now I have kicked things up a notch to counting calories again. I did this for months at one point
I was really good at it. But then travel happened. And the holidays. And more travel. And then covid.
So.. I got to the heaviest I've ever been, panicked, and now here we are at 1200 calories a day to
offset all that stress/innefectual comfort food eating I did. Needless to say, my baking list has
not changed since my last post. 

I got my pole set up ( I think I said that last time maybe?) So I have that now. And my Flex classes.
Trying to start running again. Still go biking occasionally. 

...still hate everything. 

Sorry I totally like.. whiffed writing for a month. Things got busy with the foundation's first 
virtual event. I think that went as well as it could have. People seemed surprised it went as well
as it did...but I miss my humans. I miss the connection of seeing them and drinking with them and 
playing games with them. Maybe in October, but probably not.
